      <h2>We Dont Just Watch Anime...</h2>

      <div class="description">

      <div class="slogan">We create havens for those who think they dont belong..</div>

         <p>

            We started Japanimation to create one spot for all anime fans to find cool, unique and affordable anime merch â€” because there just wasn't one around as well as hosting Comicons. We're all about experience, lifestyle, and bringing anime into a bigger conversation.

            Acrylic paint is used on the fabric. It stays permanently on clothing .The fabric is prepared by using a medium and the paint is sealed with a process called heat-setting for optimal results.

            We're here to make sure you feel welcome and find everything you're looking for.
